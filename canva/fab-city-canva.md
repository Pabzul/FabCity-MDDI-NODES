# Fab City Canva

At Fab City, we use Canva as our tool for designing social media content. In Canva we have uploaded some templates for you to modify and use so that you can adapt them to your local language, your local context, or create your own under MDDI branding guides.

Each City will have its own user and space so that you don't modify or change the other cities' files by mistake, so you can feel free to experiment and mess it up!

One access will be given by mail to each of the nodes communication coordinators by the FabCity communication team.
