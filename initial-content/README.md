# Initial Content

Here you will find some content to be used for the launch or initial stage.

We have designed an MDDI logo with the name of your City for you to share on your social media in your preferred language, announcing that you are now part of the MDDI partner institutions, inviting people to get more information on the Fab.city/MDDI webpage.

We also want to create a short video with some images of your city and your lab logo, but for that, we will need you to share it with us in the designated folder.

We also prepared a template versi√≥n of a Press Release that you can translate to your language and share with your local and specialized media to help promote your node locally.
