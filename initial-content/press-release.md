# Press Release

<mark style="color:yellow;">{Node Name}</mark> will be one of the first 8 cities to launch the Master in Design for Distributed Innovation (MDDI) this year, at the <mark style="color:yellow;">{LOCAL NODE LAB}</mark>. Led by the **Fab City Global Initiative** in collaboration with the **Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia (IAAC)** and **Fab Lab Barcelona.**

MDDI is the **next frontier** in global education. It offers a **design framework** to integrate human needs with the balance of our planetary ecosystems to nurture life **locally and globally**. The **distributed format** allows students to learn and apply new knowledge to local challenges connected to a **global community of like-minded changemakers.**

The first edition will start in October 2022 led by an experienced and **renowned faculty** in the fields of biology, digital fabrication, ecology, urban design, innovation, product design, and strategic design. **** \
\
MDDI is a 10th-month master program, it is composed of three modules organized in the tracks of Technologies, Ecosystems, and Communities.

Locally organized class groups will **experiment in their nearest Fab Labs** by prototyping and testing **new design and innovation** approaches **to address issues** such as climate change, social deprivation, economic loss, and community degradation.

\
The MDDI program is now receiving applications for its first edition which will start in October  2022.

<mark style="color:yellow;">{LOCAL NODE INFO}</mark> is the innovation space designated for students who want to take the master from Paris. This place... <mark style="color:yellow;">{LAB CHARACTERISTICS}</mark>

Over the past 10 years, working with both types of designers in the global **Fab City** and **Fab Lab Networks** we have spotlight the intersection of both formal and non-formal design, where the next great design profile will emerge. The Third and Fourth Industrial Revolutions and the Maker Movement promoted a new productive-economic paradigm based on the idea that anyone can design a product or solution without depending on factories or specialized technicians.

Through this innovative distributed learning space, Fab City is building connections between global knowledge and local needs, providing access to advanced knowledge and study accreditation to students without having to move to other countries or centers around the world.

The program is organized into three one-trimester modules following three thematic tracks: Ecosystems, Technologies, and Communities. In a final Design Studio, the tracks will be integrated and applied to the contexts of neighborhoods, cities, and bioregions.

_**Module 1**_ explores the question of _How do we design?_ The inquiry focuses on developing the technical skills needed to develop sustainable and innovative design systems based on the reconfiguration of technology, social dynamics, and resources.

_**Module 2**_ approaches our purpose, asking _Why do we design?_ This module helps establish a foundational layer of understanding of the implications of design in its relationship with natural, technological, and social ecosystems by giving students methodological tools to design valuable and meaningful solutions.

_**Module 3**_ focuses on the major design scales of _Where do we design?_ By developing different but integrated strategies of applying and developing innovative projects in an economic, social, and environmental regenerative manner.

Students apply the knowledge generated over the course of the modules towards developing and implementing a final project. The projects will generate a positive impact that integrates the local ecosystem and community through technology, a service, or a deployment.

MDDI is an internationally accredited post-graduate program, taught by a diverse international group of expert faculty including researchers, entrepreneurs, and activists. Each delivers a specially designed seminar within the above modules to address the following topics:

**Technology:** Design Tools I and II; Bio++: Bio Interactions; Holistic Technologies. Ecosystems: Bio-based Economy; Bio-Technologies; Bioregion Matters: from Labs to Ecosystems.

**Communities:** Distributed Design; Activating Communities; Social, Economic, and Environmental Impact and Evaluation.

**Cross seminars:** Propagating Collaboration; Distributed Economies: Blockchain; Distributed Leadership Behavioral Change.

Registration to start in October are now open, you can download the booklet and get more information at [www.Fab.city/MDDI](http://www.fab.city/MDDI) or contact us at [mddi@fab.city](mailto:mddi@fab.city) to study the Master in Design for Distributed Innovation in <mark style="color:yellow;">(Node Name)</mark>, or in other of our cities.
