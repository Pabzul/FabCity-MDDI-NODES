MDDI is the **next frontier** in global education. It offers a **design framework** to integrate human needs with the balance of our planetary ecosystems to nurture life **locally and globally**. The **distributed format** allows students to learn and apply new knowledge to local challenges connected to a **global community of like-minded changemakers.**\
&#x20;

The first edition will start in October 2022 led by an experienced and **renowned faculty** in the fields of biology, digital fabrication, ecology, urban design, innovation, product design, and strategic design.\
