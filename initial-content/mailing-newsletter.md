MDDI aims to integrate human needs with the balance of our planetary ecosystems to nurture life locally and globally. Thanks to its distributed and hybrid format, the program will allow participants to learn and apply new knowledge to local challenges connected to their cities, communities, and bioregions.

The first edition will start in October 2022 and will have Bali, Lima, Paris, Shanghai, and Santiago de Chile as cities confirmed so far, and three more to be confirmed. The program will be taught online by experienced and renowned faculty in the fields of biology, digital fabrication, ecology, urban design, innovation, product design, and strategic design.

Locally organized working groups will experiment in their nearest Fab Labs by prototyping and testing new design and innovation approaches to address issues such as climate change, social deprivation, economic loss, and community degradation.

Registration to start in October are now open, you can download the booklet and get more information at [www.Fab.city/MDDI](http://www.fab.city/MDDI) or contact us at [mddi@fab.city](mailto:mddi@fab.city) to study the Master in Design for Distributed Innovation in Paris, or in other of our cities.
