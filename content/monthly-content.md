# Monthly Content

There is a folder called Monthly Content where you will be able to find the content for each month, but that doesn't mean that certain content that has already been shared on any month, could be shared again in the future.

Right now some folders inside with LONG and SHORT video versions, which means that the SHORT versions are abstracts from the LONG videos, therefore we suggest that you publish the LONG versions, and use the short versions to iterate the content you share on stories tweets, or temporary posts.

By now we have two long videos:

* MDDI It's time to change
* MDDI Earth Overshoot

And you will see that basically what changes from them is the introductory approach, but both have information about the classes, the format, and the labs.

Short versions of the videos just talk about:

* &#x20;the CLASSES
* the FORMAT
* the LABS.

_During March April we are going to produce more content related to the faculty that we will share soon!_
