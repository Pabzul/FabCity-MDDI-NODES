# Open Days

We believe that on of the best ways to make people fall in love with your lab and engage them to study the master's is by visiting your institution.

We would like you to help us organize an open day in your facilities, with the following characteristics:

* Show them a little of the work you have done.
* Give them a tour around the facility and show them the machines and space.
* Get to know them and explain to them about the program and your institution.

We will be happy to help you promote it on our social media and network, and also to help you design the poster of content to invite the people to come.
